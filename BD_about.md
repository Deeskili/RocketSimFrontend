## Purpose of Our Project

Our project, the Recipe Manager, is designed to simplify the process of recipe management. It offers users a platform to store, discover, delete, and edit recipes effortlessly. We believe that cooking should be an enjoyable experience, and our application aims to make recipe management more convenient and us.er-friendly.

With Recipe Manager, you can:
- Store your favorite recipes.
- Explore new and exciting recipes.
- Easily delete recipes that no longer interest you.
- Edit recipes to suit your preferences and dietary requirements.

## How It Works

Internally, Recipe Manager operates through a seamless interaction between the backend and frontend components. Here's how it works:

1. The backend stores recipe data, including ingredients and cooking instructions.
2. The frontend communicates with the backend via an API to fetch and display the data in an aesthetically pleasing manner for users.
3. Users interact with the frontend, which sends requests to the backend through the API.
4. The backend processes these requests and sends back the necessary data for display.

## What We've Already Done

- Saathvik and Cayden have successfully created an API filled with a diverse range of recipes and ingredients. We obtained this data using an API key from a reputable recipe website, ensuring our database is both comprehensive and reliable.

- Sri and Ryan have been working on the frontend, making the website visually appealing and user-friendly. They have also added a search bar feature, enhancing the user's ability to discover recipes with ease.
